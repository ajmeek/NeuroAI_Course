    "## Reinforcement learning review\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm where an agent interacts with an environment and learns a policy to maximize its cumulative rewards. We focus here on a simple environment: a binary \"two-armed bandit\" (Figure A), a name for a gambling machine found in casinos (because it steals your money). In this task, at each opportunity the agent chooses arm $i$ (either Left $L$ or Right $R$) and gets a reward with probability $p_i$ that is unknown to the agent. On each trial, only one of the arms will return a reward, so $p_L + p_R = 1$ (which the agent does know).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/neuromatch/NeuroAI_Course/blob/main/tutorials/W1D2_ComparingTasks/static/two_armed_bandit.png?raw=true\" width=600 />\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure A. Example of binary bandit. The left arm has a probability $p_L$ of giving a reward, and the right arm a probability $p_R = 1-p_L$ of giving a reward. At a given trial, the agent pulls one of the arms and receives a reward with the corresponding probability.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the agent is to maximize its cumulative reward over a series of trials (e.g., 100 trials). This would correspond to correctly identifying the arm that returns more reward (has a higher probability) and choosing it for subsequent trials once it's sure about its choice. Thus, while solving this problem, the agent will need to balance exploration and exploitation. At a high level, more exploration is useful while the agent is not certain of which arm has more reward, and once the agent is more certain, it is more advantageous to exploit the arm that has a higher probability of reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different methods that are usually used to solve this problem. An optimal method to solve some instances of bandit problems is [Gittin indices](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rrw1/oc/ocgittins.pdf). This method incorporates the estimated rewards and their uncertainty, and involves solving an expensive dynamical programing problem. The simplest method is [epsilon greedy](https://medium.com/@ym1942/exploring-multi-armed-bandit-problem-epsilon-greedy-epsilon-decreasing-ucb-and-thompson-02ad0ec272ee), where exploration and exploitation are balanced by choosing a random action with probability $\\epsilon$ and the best known action with probability $1-\\epsilon$. In the [Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)](https://medium.com/@ym1942/exploring-multi-armed-bandit-problem-epsilon-greedy-epsilon-decreasing-ucb-and-thompson-02ad0ec272ee), the choice of action also incorporates both the estimated rewards and the estimated uncertainty of the rewards. In [Thompson sampling](https://medium.com/@ym1942/exploring-multi-armed-bandit-problem-epsilon-greedy-epsilon-decreasing-ucb-and-thompson-02ad0ec272ee), the choice is made according to a Bayesian model that estimates the posterior probabilities of the reward."

    "### Discussion point 1\n",
    "Imagine training an RL algorithm on the binary bandit problem above, with a method that depends on uncertainty about the reward probabilities (like UCB). Assume that $p_L=0.05$ and $p_R=0.95$. How rapidly will the agent become certain of its estimates of the expected reward of each arm? Do you expect the exploration phase to take a long time or a short time?\n",

    "What about the case when $p_L=0.51$ and $p_R=0.49$? How rapidly will the agent become certain of its estimates, and how will that affect the exploration phase?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer\n",
    "When one of the arms has a high reward, it is easier to identify it. The uncertainty of the agent thus reduces quickly, and they spend less time in exploration. When the probabilities of rewards are more equal (close to 0.5), a lot of trials are needed to reduce the uncertainty, and the exploration phase lasts a long time."

    "Meta-learning is a sub-field of machine learning that corresponds to a process in which an algorithm \"learns to learn\". The idea is that the algorithm will learn during training how to adapt itself to different tasks. When faced with a new task, the trained algorithm will quickly adapt to this new task without requiring additional training (the weights of the algorithm are not changed).\n",
    "\n",
    "In meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL), this concept is applied to a reinforcement learning agent. During training, the agent is exposed to different episodes with different environment, and gains meta-learning strategies. At deployment, the agent is faced with a new environment and uses the trials from that episode (the combination of actions, states and rewards) to learn a policy on the fly. Meta-RL algorithms are typically implemented using a deep learning architecture such as an LSTM. Once they are trained, the weights of the LSTM are fixed. When faced with a new episode, the activations in the LSTM implement the nested learning in which the algorithm identifies the best arm for this specific episode."

    "## Prefrontal cortex as a meta-reinforcement learning system\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the field of neuroAI has opened new avenues for understanding and developing AI systems that emulate the complexity and efficiency of the human brain to better model the human brain or to gain new functionality in AI systems. An important work in this domain is the following paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] Wang, Jane X., Zeb Kurth-Nelson, Dharshan Kumaran, Dhruva Tirumala, Hubert Soyer, Joel Z. Leibo, Demis Hassabis, and Matthew Botvinick. **\"Prefrontal cortex as a meta-reinforcement learning system.\"** Nature neuroscience 21, no. 6 (2018): 860-868.\n",
    "\n",
    "Available at: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0147-8\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper aims to reconciliate two seemingly disparate ideas about learning in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The activations in the PFC have been shown to be correlated to actions, values and rewards, indicating that the PFC is engaged in RL. Another set of findings, including the fact that PFC activity is correlated with the recent history of rewards and actions, also suggests that the PFC is acting as a meta-RL agent. The paper proposes a model of the PFC, the weights of which are optimized during training to allow it to learn a second RL algorithm dynamically, as the properties of the environment changes. The second RL algorithm is implemented by the activations of the PFC, and is independent of the original training task. This allows the PFC to adapt to new situations using prior learning experiences, essentially learning to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore here the demo in Figure 1 of the paper. Figure C belows shows the architecture of the meta-RL model, which is implemented as an LSTM. We will explore how, after training, the weights of the LSTM implement an RL procedure (e.g., we will see if this procedure deals with the exploration-exploitation tradeoff).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also explore how learning can occur at different time scales (see figure B below):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Latent world state (fast)**: In this demo, at the start of each episode, a new set of probabilities $p_L$ and $p_R = 1-p_L$ are sampled. This corresponds to latent world state parameters that change on a slower time scale than the observations level (i.e., trials), but still at a relatively fast scale (each episode here has 100 trials).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context (slow)**: We think of the context level as a slower time scale at which the world is changing and affecting how the parameters of the latent world state are sampled. In this paper, the authors train their meta-RL model in two contexts. In the first (independent bandit context), the parameters of the successive latent world state (i.e., $p_L$ and $p_R$ from two successive episodes) are not correlated. There is no specific knowledge about the parameters that can be generalized from one episode to the next. In the second (correlated bandit context), the parameters are anti-correlated. Thus, there is information in the parameters of the current episode that the model can use for faster learning in the next episode. We will explore how training in these two different contexts affects performance."

    "#### Answer\n",
    "The transition from exploration to exploitation occurs more slowly in more difficult problems, as indicated in the provided figure D. In episodes with reward parameters such as 0.6 and 0.4, where the difference in reward probability between actions is smaller, it's tougher for the agent to ascertain which action is better. Hence, more exploration is needed before a confident shift to exploitation can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, with a larger discrepancy in rewards (e.g., 0.75 vs. 0.25), the agent can more quickly determine the more rewarding action and thus switch to exploitation sooner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, in these examples, there are still instances in which 100 trials are not enough for the algorithm to converge on the correct arm even when $p_L$ is relatively small, and some in which the algorithm converges quickly to the right arm even though $p_L$ is close to 0.5. For a more robust estimation of the average duration of exploration, it would be useful to look at the behavior of the network for many episodes while using the same parameters."
